## Locating the CFMTData Folder üîé

The application data is stored in the `CFMTData` folder within your system's AppData directory. Here's how to find it:

1.  Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
2.  Type `%APPDATA%\CFMTData` and press Enter.
3.  This will open the CFMTData folder in File Explorer.

Alternatively, you can navigate to this folder manually:

- Open File Explorer
- Navigate to `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\CFMTData`

Note: The `AppData` folder is hidden by default. You may need to enable "Show hidden files and folders" in File Explorer options to see it.

## Contents of the CFMTData Folder üìÇ

Inside the CFMTData folder, you'll find several important files and directories:

1.  **mods.db**: This is the SQLite database file that stores information about your tracked mods, webhooks, and application settings.
2.  **logs/**: This directory contains log files that record application activities and errors. These can be useful for troubleshooting.

    - Log files are named in the format `log_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt`.

3.  **config.json**: (If applicable) This file stores user configuration settings that persist between application launches.
4.  **cache/**: (If applicable) This directory may contain cached data to improve application performance.

## Backing Up Your Data ‚§¥Ô∏è

It's a good practice to periodically back up your CFMTData folder, especially before updating the application or making significant changes. To do this:

1.  Navigate to the CFMTData folder as described above.
2.  Copy the entire folder to a safe location (e.g., an external drive or cloud storage).

## Resetting the Application üîÑ

If you need to reset the application to its default state:

1.  Close the CurseForge Mod Tracker application completely.
2.  Navigate to the CFMTData folder.
3.  Rename or delete the folder (renaming is safer as it allows you to recover data if needed).
4.  Restart the application. A new CFMTData folder will be created with default settings.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Deleting or modifying files in the CFMTData folder can result in loss of your tracked mods, settings, and webhook configurations. Always create a backup before making changes.

## Security and SmartScreen Alert üõ°Ô∏è

### Microsoft Defender SmartScreen Warning

When you first run CurseForge Mod Tracker, you may encounter a warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. This is a common occurrence for new or less common applications, especially those distributed outside the Microsoft Store.

### Why Does This Happen?

1. **New Application**: Our application is relatively new and may not have established a reputation with Microsoft yet.
2. **Code Signing**: As an open-source project, we currently do not use an expensive code signing certificate.
3. **Distribution Method**: We distribute directly rather than through the Microsoft Store, which can trigger additional scrutiny.

### Is CurseForge Mod Tracker Safe?

**Yes, CurseForge Mod Tracker is safe to use.** Here's why you can trust our application:

1. **Open Source**: Our entire codebase is open source and available for review on GitHub. You can inspect every line of code we use.
2. **Transparent Development**: All development is done in the open, with public pull requests and issue discussions.
3. **No Data Collection**: We do not collect any personal data or telemetry from your system.
4. **Local Operation**: The app operates locally on your machine, only connecting to CurseForge APIs for mod data.

### How to Bypass the SmartScreen Warning

If you encounter the SmartScreen warning, you can safely bypass it:

1. Click on "More info" in the SmartScreen popup.
2. Then click on "Run anyway".

### Build It Yourself

For maximum security assurance, you can build the application yourself:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/curseforge-mod-tracker.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the application: `npm run build:win` (or relevant command for your OS)

This way, you're running a version of the software that you've personally built from the source code.
